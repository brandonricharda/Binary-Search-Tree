# Binary-Search-Tree

This is my solution to The Odin Project's Binary Search Tree Exercise:

https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/data-structures-and-algorithms

The goal was to create a binary search tree that accepts unique values, has search capabilities (including depth-first), and can be added to or subtracted from. Other methods include:

- Checking to see if the tree is balanced
- Rebalancing if not
- Checking depth of the tree
- Identifying the parent of any given node
